{"result": "The term \"sinh viên\" refers to students who are enrolled in educational programs, specifically at ĐH Bách Khoa Hà Nội. These students are required to pay \"học phí,\" which is the tuition fee necessary for their education. Each semester, sinh viên must manage and inquire about their học phí as part of their academic responsibilities. Additionally, there are provisions for sinh viên to receive exemptions or reductions in their học phí based on criteria established by the Ủy ban dân tộc. For those enrolled in the CTĐT KS program, the học phí is equivalent to that of undergraduate tuition. Overall, the payment of học phí is a fundamental aspect of the sinh viên's enrollment and academic journey.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
