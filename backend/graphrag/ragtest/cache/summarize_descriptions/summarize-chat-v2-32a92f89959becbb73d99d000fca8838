{"result": "Hộ cận nghèo refers to near-poor households in Vietnam, which are defined as families that are on the brink of poverty and may qualify for various forms of support, including educational assistance. This classification is particularly relevant for students from these near-poor households, as they may be eligible for financial aid under specific support policies designed for disabled students. Thus, Hộ cận nghèo encompasses both the socioeconomic status of these households and the potential benefits available to their members, particularly in the context of education and support for disabilities.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
